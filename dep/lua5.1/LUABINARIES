This source code is distributed by the LuaBinaries project:

    http://luabinaries.luaforge.net/
    
No changes are made to the Lua.org source code.

All binaries are generated using Tecmake. If you need to build the binaries yourself 
consider using Tecmake. It is easier to install and will make your life easier.

IDE project files are also included. They were build using Premake and they are not used to
build the standard distribution. They are intended for those who want to debug Lua code
using the LuaBinaries configuration.

The standard Lua.org makefiles are still available but they do not build the dynamic libraries in UNIX.

Best Regards,
LuaBinaries Team
